# Frontend Notes

No dedicated frontend exists in this repository yet.

If a script authoring UI is introduced later:
- Keep rendering logic separate from compiler/runtime packages.
- Reuse product specs as the single source of behavior truth.
- Add UI plans under `/docs/exec-plans/active/` before implementation.
