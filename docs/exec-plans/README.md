# Execution Plans

- Put in-progress plans in `/docs/exec-plans/active/`.
- Move delivered plans to `/docs/exec-plans/completed/` in the same commit as the delivered code/docs.
- Move only after real completion is verified (implementation + docs sync + tests + quality gate all passing).
- Real completion means all Done Criteria checkboxes are checked with matching repository evidence.
- After gates pass, finalize delivery with a commit before ending the conversation.
- Use `/PLANS.md` as the required template.
- Keep `/docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md` updated when deferring work.
