# Product Sense Notes

- Authoring flow should optimize for writing story, not fighting runtime internals.
- Error messages must point to exact XML location and node identity.
- Save/restore behavior should match player expectation: resume exactly where choice waits.
- Host integration should stay explicit to avoid hidden game-state coupling.
