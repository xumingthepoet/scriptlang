# ScriptLang

`ScriptLang` is an XML-first scripting language for branching narrative games with strong data simulation support through TypeScript code nodes.

This repository is initialized for **agent-first harness engineering**:
- specs are explicit,
- architecture boundaries are strict,
- execution is plan-driven,
- quality is measured by repeatable checks.

## Project Status
- Current phase: repository initialization and governance scaffolding.
- Runtime/compiler implementation is tracked through execution plans in `/docs/exec-plans/active/`.

## Repo Map
- `/AGENTS.md`: required workflow for engineers and coding agents.
- `/ARCHITECTURE.md`: module boundaries and long-term structure.
- `/PLANS.md`: execution plan template.
- `/docs/product-specs/`: product behavior contracts.
- `/docs/design-docs/`: design principles and engineering decisions.
- `/docs/exec-plans/`: active/completed implementation plans.
- `/docs/references/`: external references that influenced this setup.

## Commands
- `npm run validate:docs`: check required docs and project scaffold integrity.
- `npm test`: alias to docs validation for initialization phase.
